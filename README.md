# kiosk
an app for viewing apps on a kiosk

### Overview
This projects is a simple web application that can be accessed by visiting the url https://tnris.github.io/kiosk. It is hosted directly from this repo using GitHub Pages. The site was created specifically to be displayed on the Texas Water Development Board's kiosk (see below photo) to act as a menu for viewing other existing TWDB web applications. Based on the user's selection from the kiosk menu, the kiosk app creates a window to that app using a dynamically created iframe while allowing the user to go back to the main kiosk menu from the bottom navigation bar. The bottom navigation bar is necessary to get back to the kiosk main menu due to the browser on the kiosk being in fullscreen mode or kiosk mode. The url of the app the user selects from the menu is displayed at the bottom right of the navigation bar.
