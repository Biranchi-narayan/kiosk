the kiosk app.

### About
The kiosk repository (repo) is a simple web application that can be accessed by visiting the url https://tnris.github.io/kiosk. It is hosted directly from this repo using GitHub Pages. The site was created specifically to be displayed on the Texas Water Development Board's kiosk (see below photo) and acts as a menu for viewing TWDB web applications. Based on the user's selection from the kiosk menu, the kiosk app creates a window to that app using a simple dynamically created iframe.
